This is my first repo, no real important content.

1. Cipher - A specific set of codec (code/decode) rules

2. Frequency Analysis - A study of patterns of letters and or groups of different letters in a ciphertext.

3. Crib - Common words (ex. the) that come up a lot, making a message easier to decode.

4. Cryptonium Pipe - The path in which the encrypted message will go through the internet.

5. Asymmetric Encryption - Both sides do not have the same key and are not able to decode the message.
